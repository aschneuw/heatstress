## Project Title

**Impact of climate change on the landscape of the dairy sector in Switzerland over the past decades**

## Description

Climate change, as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and global population growth, has become a major challenge for humanity. The global increase in temperature and humidity amplifies local impact on livestock husbandry. Heat stress (HS) is defined as body hyperthermia in mammals due to excessive heat loads that cannot be sufficiently dissipated. Modern dairy cows are more susceptible to HS due to higher metabolic activity during lactation compared to other animals.

Based on projected growth in the human population, the global food demand is estimated to increase by 60 to 70% by 2050 {{< cite "makkar_review_2018" >}} to test.
